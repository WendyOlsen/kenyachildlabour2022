Abstract
Child labour are common in certain regions of Kenya. Using 2015/6 Kenyan Integrated Household Survey, we tested for regional differences along with household variables.  Carefully measuring children’s time on work activities, excessive time worked was calculated.  Hazardousness of each sector was integrated.  The GDP contribution located in the mining and quarrying industry is a push factor. Children living with a more-educated female carer are less likely to be “child labour”. Religion was statistically associated with child labour. Excessive hours of work were common from age 10+. The paper integrates the ILO and UNICEF orientations.

To use the code, study the cleaning file then apply it to the dataset 2015/6 Kenyan Integrated Household Survey.  Get the variables from the other 'county level' data sources.  Finally, after adjusting all variables by centring them, run the code using rstan package of R.  We used v3.5 of R.
